# Test Plan: SauceDemo E-Commerce Website

## 1. Introduction

This test plan describes the approach and scope for manual testing of the [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) e-commerce web application.  
The objective is to verify the main business flowsâ€”login, product selection, cart management, and checkout and ensure the application is robust against common bugs.

- Ensure correct display of product data and prices
- Verify user input validation and error messages
- Identify and document any defects or UI issues

## 3. Scope

**In-Scope:**
- User authentication (login/logout)
